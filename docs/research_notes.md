# RV Dealership Service-to-Sales Audit Research

## Industry Context

- RV Dealerships are data-rich but often data-siloed.
- Key DMS Players: IDS (Integrated Dealer Systems), Lightspeed, DealerRock, Astra G2.
- Data Availability: Most DMS have analytics modules (e.g., IDS Leadership Insights) but they are often generic.
- Service-to-Sales Gap: Service departments are gold mines for sales leads (trade-ins, warranties, parts), but data is often trapped in work orders.

## Competitive Landscape

- Consulting Firms: Moss Adams, Brown + (Focus on tax, accounting, compliance).
- Software/Platforms:
  - AutomotiveMastermind: Strong in automotive for working the service drive.
  - CheckVentory: Inventory auditing.
  - DLR360: Explicitly mentions using sales analytics for hidden upsell in fixed ops.
  - CDPs (Customer Data Platforms): Emerging as a way to unlock first-party data.
- Niche Gap: A specific, high-touch Audit model focused solely on RV service-to-sales conversion seems less crowded than general automotive CRM/DMS.

## Technical Feasibility Points

- Data Extraction: DMS systems often allow CSV/Excel exports or have APIs (IDS Astra G2).
- Analysis: Can be automated via Python/SQL scripts once data is structured.
- Integration: Recurring model requires API or scheduled exports.

## Strategic Framing

- Consulting vs. Software: The $5,000 price point suggests a Productized Service or Consulting model initially.
- Outcome Focus: "$100k+ in pipeline" is a strong hook for a $5k fee (20x ROI).
